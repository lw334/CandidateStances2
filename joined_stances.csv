Poorly-planned growth will result in more traffic and sprawl and a reduced quality of life in our communities, so we need to better manage that growth. The state of Colorado needs to be a better partner in working with local communities to engage in effective local and regional planning for smart growth that will help reduce traffic and make our communities more livable, not less, in the coming years. Affordable Housing. The cost of housing for both homeowners and renters is increasing across the state and the Denver metro region is becoming increasingly unaffordable as more people pay a disproportionate share of their income on housing costs. Leslieâ€™s Plan- We need a statewide housing strategy that provides more tools and funding to enable seniors to age in place by staying in their homes as long as possible and creating more opportunities for young people and families to become homeowners, increasing their household wealth. My plan will: create a statewide housing strategy that better identifies market gaps in affordable housing and stronger incentives for developers to build more middle class housing for both renters and homeowners; repeal the limitation on cities and counties that prohibits the ability to assess fees on housing transactions to be used to establish housing funds. More Transportation Choices. Coloradoâ€™s limited transportation dollars should be used for fixing our existing roads and bridges and expanding choices for getting around, including transit, bike lanes and walkable streets rather than new roadway capacity. We need to make our major transportation corridors more transit-friendly with tools such as advanced signal technology that helps buses travel more quickly. Leslieâ€™s Plan - State highways that are also main streets in our communities, such as Colfax Avenue and Colorado Boulevard, are not going to be widened, so we need improvements to make them safer for pedestrians, cyclists and transit riders. My plan will: prioritize â€œfix it firstâ€ funding priorities for roads and bridges in the state budget; expand state resources and support for pedestrian and bicycling safety projects and safe routes to schools; invest in new technology such as advanced signals for buses along our most congested roads.",Supports managing traffic and sprawl,http://www.leslieherodforcolorado.com/#!engaged-communities/c2ql,Infrastructure,CO
